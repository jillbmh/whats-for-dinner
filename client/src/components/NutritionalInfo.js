        Hello, everyone! Last time, we dived into the NHS Eatwell Plate, a visual tool that helps guide your food choices. But how much of each food group should you be eating for the right balance? Let&apos;s explore that further.
        <br />
        <br />
        Quantities: Getting the Right Balance
        Understanding the right amount to eat is just as crucial as knowing what to eat. Here&apos;s a closer look at what you should aim for:
        <br />
        <br />
        Fruits and Veggies: At least 5 portions a day. A portion is roughly 80g or a small piece of fruit, like an apple, or about 3 tablespoons of cooked veggies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Starchy Carbs: 6-8 servings a day. A serving could be one slice of whole-grain bread or about a third of a cup of cooked rice.
        <br />
        <br />
        Proteins: 2-3 servings a day for adults. A serving is around 70g of cooked meat or about a cup of cooked beans if you&apos;re going plant-based.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dairy or Dairy Alternatives: Aim for 2-3 servings. One serving might look like a cup of milk or a small bowl of yogurt.
        <br />
        <br />
        Oils and Spreads: Limit to small amounts. One serving is about a teaspoon.
        <br />
        <br />
        How to Make It Work
        Here&apos;s how you can incorporate these quantities into your daily meals:
        <br />
        <br />
        Breakfast: One portion of fruit (say, a banana), one serving of starchy carbs (a slice of whole-grain toast), and one serving of dairy (a cup of milk).
        <br />
        <br />
        Lunch: Two servings of veggies (a side salad), two servings of starchy carbs (a small bowl of rice), and one serving of protein (a piece of grilled chicken).
        <br />
        <br />
        Dinner: Two portions of veggies, one serving of starchy carbs, and one serving of protein.
        <br />
        <br />
        Snacks: Fruits, nuts, or a small serving of dairy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Takeaway
        Getting the quantities right takes some practice, but you&apos;ll soon get the hang of it. It&apos;s not about rigid rules but about creating a balanced plate that works for you. And hey, if you slip up sometimes, that&apos;s okay. We&apos;re all learning and growing, right?
